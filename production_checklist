CRITICAL:

Checklist:
-Security:
    -Update session secret key
    -Run session in secure mode
    -Update proxies to secure mode
    -Implement password hashing
    -Pentest for SQL injection
    -Pentest for request forgery

-Features:
    - Implement input validation on all fields
    - Implement error popup API
    - Implement registration email check
    - Handle booking conflicts
    - Email notifications
    - Sorting of dynamic lists
    - Prevent double booking
    - Improve time display
    - Prevent booking of dropoff prior to pickup
    - Location input validation (very important)
    - Rather than display precise location, display approximate location for unconfirmed bookings
    - Allow estates/shelters to provide instructions to pickers
    - Direct communication between connected parties

-Bugs:
    -Test bad request handling
    -If registration fails, dropdown is populated with empty entries
    -(Only happens sometimes) Clicking "Go back" on transfer menu then re-entering menu can cause crash (Maybe fixed?)
    - Entering estate menu as picker crashes program (Maybe fixed)
    - Estates with no timeslots still have option to book (Maybe fixed)
    - Test more on low-end mobile. When requests take a while sometimes animations seemingly play for no reason
    - This means components are being rerendered more frequently than they need to.
    - Consider using useMemo() to fix this.
    - Making changes to transfer view, clicking off the menu, then going back on causes crash (maybe fixed) (I think?)
    - if registration fails, role will be set to failure upon success (lmfao)

-Latent client demands (Client description):
    - Nothing too big yet? Just make it look nice
